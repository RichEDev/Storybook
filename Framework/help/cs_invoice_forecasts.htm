				<p>The Forecast tab provides the capability to store known payments (or expected 
					invoices) for a given contract.</p>
				<p>These can either be entered individully or generated for the whole term of the 
					contract automatically.</p>
				<div class="help_hint">
					<b>HINT: </b>An automated email notification is available that will notify of 
					overdue invoices. The forecasts specified in this section can be used to detect 
					such expected payments that have not been invoiced. This is particularly 
					important for pro-active management of budgets.

								<p>On clicking the 'Move' button, you will be transferred to the invoices tab of
