            The definition of teams is provided to allow selection of a group of individuals
            (users or employees) to be collated under a common title. Once defined, teams can
            be selected for email notifications, ownership or access permission (to contracts
            or attachments).<br />
            <br />
            The benefit of teams is that should an individual leave their post or move to a
            different role within the organisation, they only have to be removed from the team
            and not from every element within the database to which they have been assigned.
            <br />
            <br />
            User Teams are groups of defined users (those with access to Framework via a logon
            user id).<br />
            <br />
            A typical team definition may be to collate those users who work for a particular
            department of the organisation (e.g. Finance, Contract Management).
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Where are they used?</b><br />
            <br />
            User Teams are used to restrict access via the contract audience functionality or
            via an audience attachment.<br />
            <br />
            In both these cases, once an audience has been assigned, only the distinct individuals
            or members of the team assigned may access the contract or attachment in question.
            <br />
            <br />
            Once the required taggings have been completed, simply click the Update button to
            commit selections to the database. Click the Cancel button at any time to abandon
            action.
