										the contract will be permitted to be saved. If adding a contract from the

										otherwise it will renew for a further period.<br>
										The specification of this cancellation period will produce and automatically

										cancellation can, if you so wish, be specified manually.</p>
									<p>The Review period permits a time period (in months) for information collection 
										and consideration of what the next action on the contract should be.<br>
