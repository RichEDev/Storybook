                <p>The term Supplier refers to the provider of the goods or services that have 
                    been obtained and the party with whom you are holding a contract with. It is 
                    used as a generic reference throughout this application.</p>
                <p>Suppliers must be defined prior to being able to add a contract to the system.<br>
                    <br>
                    This screen allows all the relevant information about the supplier to be entered.<br>
                    <br>
                    The Address information on this screen refers to 'Primary' address. Different 
                    addresses can be specified against supplier contacts as and when they are added.</p>

                Finding a supplier
            </div>
            <div class="help_tip"><b>Tip:</b>&nbsp;By far the quickest way to locate a supplier 
                is via the Home page of Framework.<br>
                <br>
                On selecting one of the returned suppliers from the search, the supplier and it's 
                details will be automatically selected on entry to this screen.</div>
            <div class="help_body_text">
                <p>Due to the typically large number of suppliers held within the system, Framework 
                    groups them alphabetically, displaying three letters at a time in the tabbed 
                    list to the left of the screen.<br>
                    <br>
                    To change the letters displayed in the tabs, click the letter links that run 
                    horizontally above the supplier fields.</p>
                <p>Clicking between the tabs, displays all suppliers whose names begin with the tab 
                    letter are listed.<br>
                    <br>
                    Once the required supplier has been found, it can be selected simply by clicking 
                    on the name. The associated supplier information will then be loaded.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="help_tip">
                <b>Note:</b>&nbsp;Double clicking on a Supplier Details based report will also 
                navigate to the Supplier Details screen and load the relevant Supplier information.
