				Overview
			</div>
			<div class="help_overview">
				<p>By default, any report created will report on every contract in the database.</p>
				<p>The purpose of a report is to provide meaningful information from which either 
					decisions can be made or important information can be communicated to others.</p>
				<p>To make a report meaningful, it must <i>focus</i> on only the information that 
					is relevant to the information requirement.</p>
				<p>To provide this <i>focus</i>, Report Criteria must be specified. The more 
					criteria specified the narrower the focus on the data becomes.</p>

				<img src="../buttons/open.gif" onClick="toggle('1');" id="img1">&nbsp;How do I 
				add a criteria element?
			</div>
			<div class="help_body_text" id="1">
				<p>On entry to the criteria screen, any existing criteria defined against the 
					report will be displayed. Below the existing criteria are input boxes organised 
					in five columns.</p>
				<p>The input boxes are as follows: -</p>
				<p>
					<table align="center" width="500" border="1" class="inner">
						<tr>
							<td align="center" width="100" class="inner"><b>AND / OR</b></td>
							<td width="400" class="inner"><p>Specifies the logical relationship to the other 
									criteria. This is not required for the first line of criteria entered.</p>
								<p>
									<b>Example:</b>&nbsp;Vendor = Software Europe <b>AND</b> Contract Product = 
									Framework
									<br>
									or Contract Product = Framework <b>OR</b> Contract Product = Expenses<br>
								</p>
								<p>With AND, all conditions must be satisfied in order to be included in the 
									report, whereas OR will allow either to be true for it to be included in the 
									report.</p>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="inner" align="center"><b>Field Description</b></td>
							<td class="inner">This is the field for which the report is being asked to satisfy.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="inner" align="center"><b>Comparison Type</b></td>
							<td class="inner">
								<P>This is context sensitive and will make the statement read as simply as 
									possible. All entries will equate to 'is true' or 'is false'.</P>
								<P>For example, date fields&nbsp;will provide comparison dates of 'before', 'on or 
									after', whereas numeric fields will ask 'greater than' or 'equal to'.</P>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="inner" align="center"><b>Comparison Value</b></td>
							<td class="inner"><p>This is the actual value to be compared.<br>
								</p>
								<p>
									Depending on the type of field, this will be either a drop-down list of options 
									or a text box where you can enter the value.</p>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="inner" align="center"><b>User Specified?</b></td>
							<td class="inner">This check box indicates that the Comparison Value is to entered 
								at the report run time. Should this box be checked, any entry specified in the 
								Comparison Value field is ignored.<br>
								<br>
								This allows the criteria elements to by dynamic rather than static; ideal for 
								reports that are to be published Global.</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</p>
				<p>All criteria lines should be thought of as statements. For a record to be 
					included in the report (i.e. to satisfy the criteria) it's statement <u>must</u>
					read as TRUE.</p>
				<div class="help_tip">
					<b>Tip:</b>&nbsp;Never use AND when including two entries for the same field 
					using equals (=) because no entity will ever satisfy both (e.g. Each contract 
					only has a single Type selected, so it can never be Type A AND Type B).

							<td width="400" class="inner"><p>All Contract Status definitions equate to either a 
									'live' or 'archived' contract. On selection of the contract status, the 
									'Archived' field will be set as Y or N.</p>
								<p>This enables easy exlusion of all 'Archived' contracts resulting in reporting of 
									'live' contract data only.</p>

				(Static) Criteria
			</div>
			<div class="help_body_text" id="3">
				<p>If criteria rows have the Comparison Value completed on this screen, the 
					criteria is fixed every time the report is run.</p>
				<p>Even if the report is published as Global, the report will execute with the same 
					criteria applied each time. As only the Contract Owner can modify a Global 
					report, this results in loss of flexibility and usefulness of the report.</p>
				<p>For some fields this will be fine. For the best results and the least overhead 
					in generating reports, these fixed criteria should be mixed with Variable 
					criteria.</p>
			</div>

		<div class="help_section">
			<div class="help_section_title">
				<img src="../buttons/open.gif" onclick="toggle('4');" id="img4">&nbsp;Variable 
				Criteria
			</div>
			<div class="help_body_text" id="4">
				<p>Variable criteria means that the executor of the report will be prompted to 
					complete the criteria item prior to the report being executed against the 
					database.</p>
				<p>For example, if a 'month end' report was generated, the month in question could 
					have the date range applied as Variable criteria, thus removing the need to 
					edit the report template each month. On running the report, the user will be 
					prompted to enter start and end period date for which the monthly report is to 
					retrieve data for.</p>
				<p>It is strongly recommended that Variable criteria be implemented for reports 
					that are to be published as Global. It is not necessary for all criteria 
					elements to be Variable, as it may be important for some to remain static. The 
					use of Variable criteria will add flexibility to the report you are creating.</p>
