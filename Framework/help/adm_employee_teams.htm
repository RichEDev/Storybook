            The definition of teams is provided to allow selection of a group of individuals
            (users or employees) to be collated under a common title. Once defined, teams can
            be selected for email notifications, ownership or access permission (to contracts
            or attachments).<br />
            <br />
            The benefit of teams is that should an individual leave their post or move to a
            different role within the organisation, they only have to be removed from the team
            and not from every element within the database to which they have been assigned.
            <br />
            <br />
            Employee Teams are groups of defined employees (as defined in the employee management
            section).<br />
            <br />
            These are employees of the organisation who are involved in some way with the information
            held in the database, but may not actually be users of the application and have
            no access via a logon.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Where are these teams used?</b><br />
            <br />
            Employee teams are used for tagging those with an interest in the data held. This
            includes contract ownership, email notification and user defined fields that reference
            the employee lists.
            <br />
            <br />
            In the case of email notification, a team can prevent the need to update multiple
            entries when an employee leaves or moves role within the organisation as they can
            simply be removed from the team definition.
            <br />
            <br />
            Once the required taggings have been completed, simply click the Update button to
            commit selections to the database. Click the Cancel button at any time to abandon
            action.
