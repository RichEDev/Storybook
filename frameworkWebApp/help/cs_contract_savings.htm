        <div class="help_overview">
            Contract Savings is provided as a means of logging when, whether by alternative
            sourcing or by negotiation, a product or service has been obtained at a better rate
            than previously.
            <br />
            <br />
            The saving made from the annual budget is often interpreted as being as good a 10
            times the equivalent made in profit.
            <br />
            <br />
            To this end, many people in the procurement, finance and contract roles have their
            performance judged by the amount of savings they are able to make annually from
            previous years.
            <br />
            <br />
            Such savings can be logged and associated with the contract in question in this
            area of the application, thus allowing accurate reporting of savings made over a
            given period of time and what areas of the business.
