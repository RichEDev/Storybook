				Version Registry
			</div>
			<div class="help_overview">
				The product version registry allows the accurate management of multiple 
				versions or releases of a single product.<br>
				<br>
				For example, over a number of years, a word processing application may undergo 
				numerous releases, resulting in release 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 2.0. A company may 
				over this period have bought numerous copies of the word processing 
				application. They now have a single type of word processing application but 
				four different versions.<br>
				<br>
				The version registry allows the user to manage the number of releases held. In 
				the event of an upgrade being purchased, the company is merely superseding the 
				specifications of one of the earlier releases and not actually purchasing an 
				additional copy. This is especially the case with desktop software. Such 
				upgrades can be easily managed by specifying the number of upgrades and what 
				release they are moving to and the registry will tally the releases correctly.

				SELECT Version Registry<br>
				<br>
				SELECT Insert<br>
				<br>
				The user is prompted to enter a version description, version order and 
				quantity. (NB. Pressing return after each input moves to the next required 
				input)<br>
				<br>
				The version order allows specification of the chronological ordering of 
				releases. This is a required parameter, as the registry will only permit 
				upgrading to a more recent version of itself. It is recommended that version 
				orders be sequenced with enough space to insert a version later if the need 
				should arise (i.e. enter version orders of 5,10,15 etc.)<br>
				<br>
				<b>Upgrading a product</b><br>
				<br>
				If an upgrade of a product is to take place, the drop down list should be used 
				to select the newer version that is being moved to<br>
				<br>
				On clicking the 'Upgrade' button, the user is prompted to enter the quantity to 
				be upgraded (NB. This cannot exceed the quantity of that version held). The 
				quantity will be transferred automatically.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Delete a Version</b><br>
				<br>
				Only versions with a quantity of zero can be deleted. On clicking the 'Delete' 
				button, those entries with a quantity of zero will have a selection check box 
				placed to the left of them. Tick each entry that is to be deleted and then 
				click the 'Delete' button after the arrow. The selected entries are then 
				removed.<br>
				Selecting 'Print' takes the active product shown on the registry and outputs it 
				in the standard Framework print preview facility.<br>
				<br>
				From here the data can be printed, exported to Excel or sent as an email 
				attachment.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Update Contract Products </b>
				<br>
				<br>
				If the check box is selected, the contract product quantities are updated 
				according to the quantities held for each product in the Version Registry.<br>
				<br>
				The database is only updated once the 'Close' button is clicked to exit the 
				registry.
